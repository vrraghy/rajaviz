This is an attempt to visualise the number of Ilaiyaraaja's songs by various singers.

- Each singer appears as a node.
- The size of each node is proportional to the number of songs by them.
- A link means that the singers have sung together.

**Counts**
- Hover over a singer to see their count.
- Hover over a link to see the number of songs 2 singers have sung together.
- The links to chorus have been removed to eliminate clutter.

**Issues**
- Data: There are plenty of issues with the data, and hence with the viz. Cleaning them programmatically might be damaging.
- Performance: This takes up to 7 seconds to load, and isn't quite responsive. I'm trying to improve this.
- Platform: I have tested this only on my desktop. It would be nice to get this working on mobiles too.

**Plans**
- I'd like to expand this to include very many features, but don't have enough skill. Yet. Working on that :)

**Request**
- No, I don't want money, but I'm looking to crowdsource the effort to standardise & clean the data, with Google Sheets. Do reach me on [@vrraghy](https://twitter.com/vrraghy) if you're interested.
- Of course, please do feel free to fork this repo.
